title: A (long) Day on Mercury
summary: A simulation that shows the length of a day on Mercury
nice-name: mercury-orbit
instructions: Press the play button to start the animation. Use the slider to manually control the orbit of Mercury.
explanation: Mercury is tidally locked to the sun which leads to a special relation between its own rotation and its orbit around the sun. During two orbits, Mercury will rotate around its own axis three times. This has the effect of creating very long periods of brightness and darkness for an observer on the surface of Mercury. Another interesting moment occurs when the sun appears to stop and then move backwards during its diurnal motion. (see if you can find this point!)
