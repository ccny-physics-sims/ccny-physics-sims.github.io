explanation: Now known as the Huygens-Fresnel Principle, this interpretation of light posits that wavefronts are just the sum of many spherical wavelets. This was proposed in in 1678 by Christiaan Huygens and refined by Augustin-Jean Fresnel a century or so later. This simulation takes as inspiration a figure from Huygens' <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14725/14725-h/14725-h.htm#Page_15"> Treatise on Light</a>.
