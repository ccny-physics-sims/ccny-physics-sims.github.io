title: The Bohr / de Broglie Model
summary: Change the energy level of the electron in this Bohr Model
nice-name: bohr-model
instructions: Use the sliders to control the n value (i.e. energy level). Notice how non-integer n values lead to a gap in the wave, indicating that they do not create a standing wave.
explanation: We now know this model is incorrect, however, it does have an important place in the history and development of modern quantum mechanics.
