title: A Decaying Sinusoidal Function
summary: Change the coefficients that determine a basic sine function
nice-name: plot-decaying-sine
instructions: Change the slider to change the damping envelope.
explanation: An oscillator's amplitude will decrease over time. How quickly depends on the damping.
