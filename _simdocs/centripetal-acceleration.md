title: Centripetal Acceleration Vectors
summary: Observe the acc. and vel. vectors for an object moving in a circle.
nice-name: centripetal-acceleration
instructions: The start/stop button will start or stop the animation. The slider affects the speed of rotation.
explanation: For an object to rotate around in a circle, there needs to be an acceleration towards the center of the circle. This is indicated by the purple vector. The green vector shows the velocity of the object. The relation between the centripetal acceleration and the speed is given by $$a_\textrm{cent} = \frac{v^2}{r}$$ so if the speed of rotation increases, so will the centripetal acceleration.
