title: Pendulum Vectors
summary: Inspect the acceleration and velocity vectors for a pendulum
nice-name: pendulum-vectors
instructions: Start and Stop the animation using the button.
explanation: The acceleration of a pendulum is of course a maximum at the two extremes, when the velocity is zero - that's the hallmark of simple harmonic motion. At the bottom of the travel, the velocity is a maximum, however, the pendulum bob is still moving in a curved way, so there must be an acceleration towards the center of the circle. This sim shows the two vectors and the continuous dance back and forth during the oscillations.
