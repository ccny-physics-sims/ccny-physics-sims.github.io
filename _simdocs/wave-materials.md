title: Wave in a medium
summary: See the wavelength change as a wave passing thought different mediums
nice-name: wave-materials
instructions: Adjust the sliders to change the index of refraction on the right, and the frequency of the incoming wave
explanation: Since the wave must be continuous across the boundary, the frequency of oscillations must be constant.
