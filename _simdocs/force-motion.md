title: Force and Motion
summary: A replica of an old simulation.
nice-name: force-motion
instructions: Use the arrow keys to change the direction and magnitude of the force applied to the mass. Watch the velocity change in response. (Also, on mobile, tilt your device to change the force.)
explanation: This is a replica of a very early computer simulation. Watch the video here <a href="http://techchannel.att.com/play-video.cfm/2012/8/20/AT&T-Archives-Force-Mass-Motion">http://techchannel.att.com/play-video.cfm/2012/8/20/AT&T-Archives-Force-Mass-Motion</a>
