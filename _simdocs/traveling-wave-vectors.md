title: Traveling Wave Vectors
summary: Visualize the velocity of the constituent particles of a traveling wave.
nice-name: traveling-wave-vectors
instructions: Move the slider to change the speed of the wave.
explanation: The velocity of the medium is always transverse compared to the velocity of the wave. The green vectors show the velocity of the medium, which in this case is only up or down. The wave velocity is shown by the blue arrow, which is to the right or left.
