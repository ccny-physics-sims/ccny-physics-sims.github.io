title: Diffraction Grating Intensity graph
summary: Adjust the variables in a n-slit (i.e. diffraction grating) experimental setup to see their effects on the intensity plot.
nice-name: N-slits
instructions: Change the variables using the sliders
explanation: This sim allows you change the slit spacing, the wavelength, and the amplitude of the light.
