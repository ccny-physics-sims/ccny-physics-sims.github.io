title: Orders of Magnitude
summary: How big is a circle that is 100 times wider?
nice-name: orders-of-magnitude
instructions: Use the slider to scale the circle on the right. Observe the relative size with the unit circle on the left.
explanation: Orders of magnitude are useful in science to express quantities that are either very large or very small. However, it's often hard to appreciate just how much larger a factor of 1000 is. Here, we adjust the diameter of the circles and note how big they get. Note, the area of the circles will scale differently since $$\textrm{area} = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2$$.
