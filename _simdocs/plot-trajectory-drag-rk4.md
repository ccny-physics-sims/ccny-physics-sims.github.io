title: Plot a Trajectory with Drag
summary: This simulation solves the differential equations for projectile motion with both linear and quadratic drag and plots the result, allowing for comparison between different drags.
nice-name: plot-trajectory-drag-rk4
instructions: Move the sliders to adjust the drag coefficients and launch angle. Press Save to store the last trajectory to compare.
