title: A kinematic cart simulator
summary: See the ball fall back into the cup.
nice-name: kinematic-cart-flat
instructions: click in the space above the cart to launch the ball.
explanation: The x and y motions are independent. The cart always stays in the same x position as the ball, unless there is an acceleration acting on the ball, like drag.
