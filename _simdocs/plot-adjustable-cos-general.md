title: General Cosine Plot
summary: Change the coefficients that determine a basic cosine function
nice-name: plot-adjustable-cos-general
instructions: Move the sliders to adjust the amplitude, omega (period), the phase phi.
explanation: A sinusoidal function can be determined by 3 parameters. The amplitude of oscillation $C$, the frequency $\omega$ and the phase $\phi$.
