title: Simple Color Mixing
summary: Arrange the three circles to experiment with mixing 3 colors
nice-name: color-mixing-basic
instructions: Use the mouse or your finger to grab a circle by the little tab and move it around so that it overlaps with the others and creates a secondary color.
explanation: There is quite a lot of physics involved with the mixing of colors. This simple sketch shows the elementary school version where we mix Yellow, Blue, and Red to make Green, Orange, and Purple.
