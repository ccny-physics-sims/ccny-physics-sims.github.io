title: Summing up many Sin waves
summary: This is an abstract representation of the Uncertainty Principle.
nice-name: summed-sinewaves
instructions: Use the radio buttons to select the number of sine waves added up. Each has a slightly different frequency.
explanation: When viewing a single sine wave, it's straightforward to measure its frequency, or wavelength. However, a question anything about its position is not easy to answer. When you had more sine waves together, this changes. At n = 50, we can see where the wave has the largest amplitude, but it's now harder to describe its frequency in any meaningful way.
