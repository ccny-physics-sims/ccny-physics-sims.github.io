summary: A 3d model earth in orbit around the sun
nice-name: earth-in-orbit-simple
instructions: Rotate the scene using the mouse/touch.
explanation: The earth is in a nearly spherical orbit around the sun. One major complication is that the earth rotates around an axis that is tilted with respect to the orbital plane. (hence - our lovely seasons)
