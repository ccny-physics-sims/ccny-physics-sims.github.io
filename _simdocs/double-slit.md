title: Double Slit Intensity graph
summary: Adjust the variables in a double slit experimental setup to see their effects on the intensity plot.
nice-name: double-slit
instructions: Change the variables using the sliders
explanation: This sim allows you change the slit spacing, the wavelength, and then choose whether or not to include effects of single slit diffraction.
