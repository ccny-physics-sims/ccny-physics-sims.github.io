title: Mass on a Ramp Free Body Diagram
summary: Adjust the angle of a ramp and see how the free body diagram changes. (Does not include friction)
nice-name: mass-on-ramp-no-friction-fbd
instructions: Use the slider to adjust the angle theta.
explanation: For a mass on a frictionless ramp, there will be two forces acting. Gravity, and the Normal force. Gravity always is directed straight down and doesn't change magnitude, while the normal force will always be directed perpendicular to the surface of the ramp and its magnitude will be given by $$F_\textrm{N} = mg \cos \theta$$.
