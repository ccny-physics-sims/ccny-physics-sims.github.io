title: Rotating Reference Frame
summary: Compare the motions of a projectile between reference frames
nice-name: rotating-ref-frame
instructions: Use the two sliders to adjust the speed and angle of the ball. Click to start to launch the projectile. Note how the motion is a straight line in the inertial frame, but in the rotating frame, the pseudo-forces cause it to appear to move in a different path.
explanation: The Pseudo-Forces that are created if you are in a rotating reference frame are described by the following equations $$\mathbf{F}_\textrm{rot} = \mathbf{F}_\textrm{in}\; \underbrace{- m \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \left( \boldsymbol{\omega } \times \mathbf{r} \right)_\textrm{rot} }_\textrm{centrifugal}\; \underbrace{- 2 m \left( \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{v}_\textrm{rot} \right)_\textrm{rot}}_\textrm{Coriolis} \; \underbrace{- m \left( \dot{\boldsymbol{\omega}} \times \mathbf{r} \right)_\textrm{rot}}_\textrm{Euler}$$ This simulation allows you to launch a projectile and then observe the motion as it would happen in both the intertial frame as well as the rotating frame. <br/>Some things to try. Can you find an initial trajectory that allows the person in the rotating frame to catch the ball after some time? <br/>Also, note how the trajectory is a straight line in the inertial frame, as it should be if no forces are acting on it.
