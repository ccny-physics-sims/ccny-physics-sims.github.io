title: Velocity and Acceleration Vectors
summary: Control a particle by changing its acceleration vector and observing the change in the velocity.
nice-name: mover-accelerates-2d-controls
instructions: Use the arrow keys as input or touch the control circle to change the acceleration vector components. Observe how the velocity vector responds.  
explanation: In kinematics, we learn how acceleration changes the velocity of a particle. In this interactive simulation, you can control the acceleration, and the velocity will respond. Try to make the particle stop moving or even more challenging go in a circle.
