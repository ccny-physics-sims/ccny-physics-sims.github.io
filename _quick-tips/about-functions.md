title: About functions

A function, in our context, is essentially a way of references a set of instructions, without having to write them all out again.

An analogy: Someone says "clean your room", that means do a whole bunch of other things (i.e. pick up cloths off floor; change bed sheets; remove old coffee cups). `CleanYourRoom()` is interpreted by you to mean do all those things.
