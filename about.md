Welcome to the Science Sims at CCNY. We build modern simulations to illustrate scientific principles.

The goal of this project is twofold:

  a) _to build new, simulations of basic science concepts, and_

  b) _to train the next generation of scientists and engineers in the art of programming and science communication._

We use modern web tools to build ultra clear simulations that illustrate an abstract concept or idea from basic science, without cluttering the screen with unnecessary elements.
