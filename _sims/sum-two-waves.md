title: Sum of Two Sine Waves
summary: Add two sine waves and change the relative phase
nice-name: sum-two-waves
instructions: Move the slider to change the phase difference between the two waves. The purple wave shows the sum of the red and the blue waves.
explanation: The phase difference between two waves affects how they add. If they are <i>in-phase</i>, the wave amplitude will double. If they are <i>out of phase</i>, they will cancel.
