I've been using these sims in courses for the last few years. However, like so many projects, I've let the regular maintenance and updating of this site fall a little bit behind. Since the spring will no doubt involve a lot of online teaching for me, it's time to dust off the furniture and make sure none of the pipes have burst in my absence.

I've had lots of ideas for sims during the last year and will spend some time building more, and hopefully encourages others to do so as well. Stay tuned to our channels for more.

Sincerely,

James Hedberg
