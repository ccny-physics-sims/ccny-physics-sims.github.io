Have an idea for a sim? Or see something that's not quite right on an existing sim? Go ahead and make it an issue on our github repo:

If it's related to a sim, use this link:

[https://github.com/ccny-physics-sims/sims/issues](github issue for sims)

If it's related to the website, then try this one:
